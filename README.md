# Minishell

The objective of this project is to recode a shell like Bash. A shell is the interface between the user and the computer core. We recoded this project in C. I did the execution part while Mouslim did the parsing, We also splitted differents tasks such as the builtins, the expand, the prompt and the tokenisation.
